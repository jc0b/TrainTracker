# TrainTracker
An Android application to keep track of which NS trains you've been on before.

## What's the point?
It was a fun hobby that we decided to make a utility app for. We wanted to learn Android Programming anyways, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## How do I build it?
Import it as a Gradle project into Android Studio (or your otherwise preferred IDE)

## What is in the works for this?
Getting it working, obviously. We'll also try and integrate releases built by Travis-CI in the near future.

## Project Information
We are targeting Android API 26 (8.0 Oreo) with this project, but the minimum version is API 22 (5.0 Lollipop) in order to get some of that good compatibility. We're using Build Tools 26.0.2 for this project.
