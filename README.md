# TrainTracker
An Android application to keep track of which NS trains you've been on before.

## What's the point?
It was a fun hobby that I decided to make a utility app for. I wanted to learn Android Programming anyways, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## How do I build it?
Import it as a gradle project into Android Studio (or your otherwise preferred IDE)

## What is in the works for this?
Getting it working, obviously. I'll also try and integrate releases built by Travis-CI in the near future.
